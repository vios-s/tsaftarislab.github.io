Jingshuai Liu received the bachelor's degree in electronic science and technology from Tianjin University, China, in 2016, and the master's degree in signal processing and communications in 2018 from The University of Edinburgh, UK, where he received the Ph.D. degree in 2023. His research project is Compressive MRI with Deep Convolutional and Attentive Models, which concerns the incorporation of neural network models and deep learning-based methods in fast MRI reconstruction to achieve high image quality from sparsely sampled signals. During his study, Jingshuai Liu gained background knowledge in image processing, medical imaging, deep learning and neural network models, and developed independent and collaborative research ability and communication skills. His research interests include image processing, machining learning, medical imaging, and computer vision.
