Michael Camilleri is a Postgraduate Research Associate with CHAI at the University of Edinburgh as well as Associate Staff at the University of Dundee. His research focus is on Probabilistic Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science, with a special interest in applying techniques to clinical data. 

Michael obtained a B.Sc. in Communications and Computer Engineering (University of Malta), before coming to Edinburgh to study for an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. Subsequently he worked in industry, returning to the University of Edinburgh for a PhD in Data Science, supervised by Prof. Chris Williams: his thesis centred around characterising the coupled and hierarchical nature of social interactions of group-housed lab mice. This also involved a collaboration with Prof. Andrew Zissermann and the VGG group at Oxford towards tracking and behaviour recognition from video. 

Apart from a strong technical background in probabilistic modelling and deep learning, Michael has experience in various applied fields, including Robotics, Transport Modelling, Radio-Telescopes, Behaviour Modelling and above all Clinical Imaging (having been a researcher on the SCANDAN project leading to the Brain Health Dataset). He has worked across Industry and Academia, and is the author of several peer-reviewed journal and conference publications. He is also a full-time husband/father and enjoys volunteering at heritage railways (particularly Steam Locomotives).
