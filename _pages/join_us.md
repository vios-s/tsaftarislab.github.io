* ~~**PhD student in Causal Digital Twins**: We have full funding for a position in causal AI to drive the simulation of digital twins. This is inspired by applications in healthcare and in particular Computer Assisted Surgery.  Very interesting questions arise here: *How do we learn to co-train a causal AI and a digital twin from scarce data in a compute efficient manner? What happens if the few real data we have are biased?* We will be reviewing applications as they arrive on a rolling basis starting from December 15, 2023 (early application is encouraged). We would like to have someone start by September 2024 the latest, but earlier is also possible and welcome. **To apply** visit this [page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=947). Include the name of Prof. Tsaftaris in the statement, under funding add "Project funding by Prof. Tsaftaris", and in the proposal page draft two pages with the title "Proposal for Causal Digital Twin PhD topic of Tsaftaris" and include your understanding of causal AI and how it might help drive digital twin simulations. (Note that we are not looking for ideas here per se; we just want to see how you shape your thoughts.) Once you have applied please email your application number to Prof. Tsaftaris.~~
* ~~**PhD student in Foundation Models in CV**: We have full funding for a position in leveraging foundation generative models for applications where training data are scarce. Our goal is to create ready-to-use computer vision bespoke models inspired by applications in health and agriculture.  Very interesting questions arise here: e.g. *Do synthetic data always help? Can we prompt the generation of data that correct for (real) data biases? Can we prompt with examples to train generic solvers based on primitives?*  We will be reviewing applications as they arrive on a rolling basis starting from December 15, 2023 (early application is encouraged). We would like to have someone start by September 2024 the latest, but earlier is also possible and welcome. **To apply** visit this [page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=947). Include the name of Prof. Tsaftaris in the statement, under funding add "Project funding by Prof. Tsaftaris", and in the proposal page draft two pages with the title "Foundation Models in CV PhD topic of Tsaftaris" and include your understanding of foundation models and how currently foundation models are adapted to work in small data settings. (Note that we are not looking for ideas here per se, but we just want to see how you shape your thoughts.) Once you have applied please email your application number to Prof. Tsaftaris.~~   

* ~~**PhD student in Vision-Language models**: We seek applications for a position to investigate multi-modal models, with respect to the underlying data representations, in relation to their respective modalities. Self-supervision from image–text pairs has enabled the development of flexible general-purpose vision–language models, recently in specialised domains such as biomedicine and radiology. Questions that arise include: *are specialized encoder and decoder architectures for different data modalities optimal?, can modality agnostic representations, e.g. implicit neural representations bring advantages  to multi-modal models?*. We will be reviewing applications as they arrive on a rolling basis starting from December 15, 2023 (early application is encouraged). We aim for someone to start by September 2024 latest, but earlier is also possible and welcome. **To apply** visit this [page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=947). Include the name of Dr. McDonagh in the statement, and in the proposal page draft two pages with the title "Vision-Language models PhD topic of McDonagh" and include your understanding of Vision-Language models and implicit neural representations (e.g. functa). (Note that we are not looking for ideas here per se, but we just want to see how you shape your thoughts.) Once you have applied please email your application number to Dr. McDonagh.~~
