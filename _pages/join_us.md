## Current opportunities {#opportunities}
We have several fully funded positions.

* **Four PostDoctoral Research Associate Positions in Causal AI**: We are for **four** enthusiastic postdoctoral researchers to join our team led by Prof. Sotirios Tsaftaris in the prestigious high-profile [CHAI AI Hub](https://chai.ac.uk) funded by EPSRC to help us develop new causal AI methods as applied to a variety of healthcare applications co-created within an ecosystem of partners and stakeholders. Our aspiration is to change the future of healthcare precisely because we devise better AI methods rooted in causal. Deadline 17 June 2024. **To apply** [Review details and apply now here](https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/10473/?utm_medium=jobshare)~~  

* **PhD student in Causal Digital Twins**: We have full funding for a position in causal AI to drive the simulation of digital twins. This is inspired by applications in healthcare and in particular Computer Assisted Surgery.  Very interesting questions arise here: *How do we learn to co-train a causal AI and a digital twin from scarce data in a compute efficient manner? What happens if the few real data we have are biased?* We will be reviewing applications as they arrive on a rolling basis starting from December 15, 2023 (early application is encouraged). We would like to have someone start by September 2024 the latest, but earlier is also possible and welcome. **To apply** visit this [page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=947). Include the name of Prof. Tsaftaris in the statement, under funding add "Project funding by Prof. Tsaftaris", and in the proposal page draft two pages with the title "Proposal for Causal Digital Twin PhD topic of Tsaftaris" and include your understanding of causal AI and how it might help drive digital twin simulations. (Note that we are not looking for ideas here per se; we just want to see how you shape your thoughts.) Once you have applied please email your application number to Prof. Tsaftaris.


## Past opportunities {#pastopportunities}
* ~~**PhD student in Foundation Models in CV**: We have full funding for a position in leveraging foundation generative models for applications where training data are scarce. Our goal is to create ready-to-use computer vision bespoke models inspired by applications in health and agriculture.  Very interesting questions arise here: e.g. *Do synthetic data always help? Can we prompt the generation of data that correct for (real) data biases? Can we prompt with examples to train generic solvers based on primitives?*  We will be reviewing applications as they arrive on a rolling basis starting from December 15, 2023 (early application is encouraged). We would like to have someone start by September 2024 the latest, but earlier is also possible and welcome. **To apply** visit this [page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=947). Include the name of Prof. Tsaftaris in the statement, under funding add "Project funding by Prof. Tsaftaris", and in the proposal page draft two pages with the title "Foundation Models in CV PhD topic of Tsaftaris" and include your understanding of foundation models and how currently foundation models are adapted to work in small data settings. (Note that we are not looking for ideas here per se, but we just want to see how you shape your thoughts.) Once you have applied please email your application number to Prof. Tsaftaris.~~   

* ~~**PhD student in Vision-Language models**: We seek applications for a position to investigate multi-modal models, with respect to the underlying data representations, in relation to their respective modalities. Self-supervision from image–text pairs has enabled the development of flexible general-purpose vision–language models, recently in specialised domains such as biomedicine and radiology. Questions that arise include: *are specialized encoder and decoder architectures for different data modalities optimal?, can modality agnostic representations, e.g. implicit neural representations bring advantages  to multi-modal models?*. We will be reviewing applications as they arrive on a rolling basis starting from December 15, 2023 (early application is encouraged). We aim for someone to start by September 2024 latest, but earlier is also possible and welcome. **To apply** visit this [page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=947). Include the name of Dr. McDonagh in the statement, and in the proposal page draft two pages with the title "Vision-Language models PhD topic of McDonagh" and include your understanding of Vision-Language models and implicit neural representations (e.g. functa). (Note that we are not looking for ideas here per se, but we just want to see how you shape your thoughts.) Once you have applied please email your application number to Dr. McDonagh.~~

Full funding and tuition fees for exceptional international candidates available too. Apply now for quicker consideration (deadline Nov 30, 2022). Check the details at the [school of engineering](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/research/phd/causal-representation-learning-robust-healthcare-predictions) or [FindAPhD](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/causal-representation-learning-for-robust-healthcare-predictions/?p138796) pages.~~

* ~~**PostDoc on Causal Representation Learning from Rare Data (CLOSING SOON, 21 October 2022):** We are looking for an enthusiastic postdoctoral researcher to join our team led by Prof. Sotirios Tsaftaris in a prestigious high-profile [project](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/X017680/1) (funded by EPSRC New Horizons). Prior work in our group (Hartley & Tsaftaris, arXiv 2022 and Jegorova et al, arXiv, 2021) has shown that supervised AI models are very susceptible to spurious correlation even when it is extremely rare. We don’t know how the representations are affected, or how shortcut learning contributes, or whether this is a pure artifact of stochastic training. You will interact with Amazon Web Services, Canon Medical and visit ELLIS Units in Europe. Deadline 21 October 2022.

Your English language qualification must be no more than three and a half years old from the start date of the programme you are applying to study, unless you are using IELTS, TOEFL, PTE Academic or Trinity ISE, in which case it must be no more than two years old.
* **Making Informal Enquiries Informative**: Applications [for open positions] must be submitted through the online University system. Informal enquiries (excluding questions on the application process and scholarships) can be sent by email to Prof. Tsaftaris or any of the other supervisors). Please **clearly** state which position you are applying for in the subject line and your questions in the email and confirm that you have read this webpage. (Emails that do not clearly mention PhD topics from the ones listed above are not prioritised.) Questions on the application process and scholarships should be directed to the Postgraduate Office of the School of Engineering: EngGradOffice@ed.ac.uk. Within your enquiry, it is strongly recommended that you attach a detailed CV and the following: Details of every qualification; Academic career history; Highlight any academic success; Ranking withing your cohort (including its size); If you have published any conference or journal papers, provide links to the publication(s) and state your contribution.
